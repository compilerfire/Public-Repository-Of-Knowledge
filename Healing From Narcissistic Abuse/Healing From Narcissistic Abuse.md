# Healing From Narcissistic Abuse

-----------------------------------------

## General Principles of recovery from Narcissistic Abuse
The goal is to undo the mental conditioning, internalized self-critic, false beliefs, gaslighting,

I. Reality Validation - Reaffirmation of your personal version of realilty. Journaling the experiences, self-disclosing in safe spaces, or safe outlets, using reflective validation: "What happened **did** happen."

II. Psychoeducation - Studying the narcissism, gaslighting, rauma bodnding, cognitive dissonance - but also identification.

III. Naming the buse - Use accurate, neutrally valenced language, assertiveness (self-expressed, and to exterior when it's applicable and safe) - "That was emotional manipulation", "That was covert agression", "That was control disguised as love."

IV. Breaking the trauma bond - Recognizing the chemical-emotional addiction to the abuser. This includes withdrawal symptoms (obsesive thoughts, longing, guilt)

V. Deconstruct the False Self - Many survivors adopt i.e. cognitive, or alexthemic ('stoic') mask. Healing requires stripping this down.

VI. Cognitive Reappraisal - Replace the internalized critical voice with rational, compassionate reasoning (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy frameworks)
